## Description

This project aims to rebuild a website that was, let's admit it, quite  ugly and outdated. My mission was to give it a **fresh and modern look**, making it visually **appealing** and **user-friendly**. <br><br>

## Motivation

The original [website](https://phoenixcga.com/) served its purpose, but it lacked aesthetics and failed to provide a pleasant user experience. With this rebuild, I strive to create a more **engaging and enjoyable platform** for our users. <br><br>

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
